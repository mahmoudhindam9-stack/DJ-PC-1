# Factory DJ FX Sources

The factory sound banks use real audio files from public CC0 sources. The app does **not** synthesize replacement tones for these factory pads.

## Sources

### Boochi44/free-drum-samples
CC0 1.0. Real WAV one-shot drum kits used by the Drums and Electronic banks.
https://github.com/Boochi44/free-drum-samples

### code4fukui/sound-cc0
CC0 1.0 public-domain sound effects used by the DJ FX and Party banks.
https://github.com/code4fukui/sound-cc0

### Kenney Sci-Fi Sounds via danvanderboom/Aetherium
The repository includes a committed Kenney Sci-Fi Sounds license file and documents the included Kenney sound effects as CC0 1.0. The entire "DJ FX" bank (lasers, force fields, engine, door swooshes, impacts, sub boom) is streamed remotely from these real OGG files.

### Kenney SFX subset via euuuuuan/voidclad-public
The project's provenance documents the selected Kenney Impact/Sci-Fi files as CC0-1.0 and redistributable. Selected real OGG files are used by the Party bank.

## Runtime behavior

The Gradle task `prepareFactoryFxAssets` downloads the real source files at **build time** into generated Android assets. They are therefore packaged into the APK/AAB and are available offline at runtime.

The app does not contact these sources when a factory pad is pressed. `DjFxAudioEngine` plays `asset:///factory_fx/...` directly through the existing Media3/ExoPlayer audio path.

The task fails the build if any factory asset cannot be downloaded or is unexpectedly small, rather than silently shipping placeholder/generated audio.
